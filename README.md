# LearnBot

## ‚ùì About

```text
Learnbot is A Discord Bot scripted in Python that is designed to assist learning the Japanese Character system.
It can generate simple multiple choice exercise cards that can simply be solved by reacting with the right emoji.

The Bot can track a users progress and generates exercises designed to work on the learners weaknesses.
Exercise generation has changing parameters that allow it to generate Exercises that are often answerd wrong more regularly.

This Bot will not be updated as I am curently working on a new Version that has more organized Datastructures,
makes better use of the Discord.py functionality and runs with more efficient memory.
